Imagine that you walk into a friends home and their home is just actually dirty. That the reason they don't got time to clean is because their just always playing on the @CAPS3 technology. The issue is, people are getting lazy, and most of them won't want to spend time with their loved ones, also they'll start to get addicted to it. 
It is now or never to help these young people with their weakness as being on the internet. What would you do if you were to be with someone who was always on the internet doing nothing? Your trying to help them and they won't do it because they're just too used of doing nothing. Your house is a mess just because of the fact that they're too lazy. Well this is whats causing all this trouble. People attend to get used of being on the @CAPS3 doing nothing. That is just unacceptable, @CAPS1 have to do something bout this. 
Computer's help you keep in touch with people. Say you live in @LOCATION1 and you miss your @CAPS1.
Also computers are making most families, and couples break up. Do you really know what's causing this, is all of the @CAPS3 technology. It's hard for families to stick together and connect if their children are always playing games on the @CAPS3 and the father/mother is on the internet. This can also bring conflict to the family well only because if the kids are on the @CAPS3 while one of the parent is trying to get on that could bring conflict. And conflicts always mislead to something worst. 
Computers make human lives easier. Not only do they help kids turn in a nice neatly printed piece or paper for home work but they also help the average person. Teachers use it to keep peoples grades in order and others use it to write reports for various jobs. The @CAPS2 probably uses one to write a speech or to just keep his day in order. Computers make it easier to learn certain topics like the @LOCATION2 history. You can type something into a searcher site and have ton's of websites for one person with, who knows how much imformation. Instead of flipping through all the pages in a dictionary you can look for an online dictionary, type in the word and you have the definition.
@CAPS2 lets just try to stop using the @CAPS3 to prevent this from happening. @CAPS2 your trying to go to your friends house but he wen't up the @CAPS2 you think something going on with him. @CAPS2 you to his house to see whats going on and you come to find out is their just paying too much to the @CAPS3 because of this game. But just everytime you'll try to hang out with him he's hooked on to that same game. @CAPS2 you try to help him out by going on the date. While your on the date he's all sweaty @CAPS2 your asking him why and he says the reason why is because he is not playing the game @CAPS2 this is just leading to a conclusion which is that he's addicted to the game. 
This is one of the most dangerous things to happen. The time is now to help people to get up and out of all these crazy stuff. Would you want to have a lazy friend living with you? Would you want your family to break up because of a technology system? Or do you want to be with a boyfriend who's addicted to the technology called ""@CAPS3""? @CAPS2 let's help and prevent all of these things to happen to anyone.

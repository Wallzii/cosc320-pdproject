# Basic program configurations. Detailed descriptions below:
#
# CorpusMultipleDirectory: The directory that contains the files that will compose the corpus to check 
#   for plagiarism against. This directory is relative from the root of the project folder. 
#   Only .txt files are valid and any other file type will be ignored if located in this directory.
#   Enable with CorpusUseSingular set to False.
#
# CorpusDirectorySingular: Like CorpusDirectory above, except accepts only one file as input, where 
#   each line in that file is treated as if it were an entire document when parsing. 
#   Enable with CorpusUseSingular set to True.
#
#   NOTE: When CorpusIseSingular is enabled to True to compile the corpus from a single input file, 
#   the documents contained in that corpus will not contain paragraphs as each new line is treated 
#   as a separate file.
#
# PlagiarizedDirectory: The directory that contains the singular .txt file to check for plagiarism. 
#   If multiple files exist in this directory, only the first file found will be loaded and used 
#   for patterns when checking for plagiarism.
#
#   NOTE: this directory must not contain any sub-directories or there may be undefined behavior 
#   of the scanning algorithm.
#
# CorpusUseSingular: When set to False, corpus is compiled from a set of documents located in 
#   CorpusDirectoryMultiple. When set to True, corpus is compiled from a singular document located in 
#   CorpusDirectorySingular. This mode is mutually exclusive, so only a set of documents or a single 
#   document will be used to generate the corpus, not both. This is the DEFAULT MODE.
#
# VerboseMode: If enabled, any string matching algorithms that are run will output all matching 
#   information. If disabled, information on hits will only be displayed at the end of exeuciton. 
#
#   NOTE: this mode is typically for informational and debugging purposes only, as enabling this 
#   option will lead to very spammy output during algorithm execution.
#
# IMPORTANT: Paths for CorpusDirectory* and PlagiarizedDirectory are RELATIVE to the root project 
# directory and must NOT start with a forward-slash, which would make them absolute paths.

# Select which algorithms are used in plagiarism detection by setting Enable_* to True. Multiple 
# different algorithms may be enabled at the same time and they will be run sequentially and 
# output their results.

# To run plagiarism detection with the enabled algorithms, execute the script: 'pdproject.py'

# Analysis mode for the algorithms used in plagiarism detection. Set RuntimeAnalysis_* for any
# algorithm to True and the program will conduct an asymptotic analysis of any enabled algorithms 
# instead. 
#
# To run the analysis on the enabled algorithms, execute the script: 'analysis.py'
#
# NOTE: Each category below is plotted on its own seperate graph. Enabling more than one analysis 
# at the same time will result in each plot being displayed individually in sequential order.
